Description:
  A collaborative storytelling game/website. Users will register, and once logged in, 
  may either start a new story or contribute to an already existing one. Before 
  contributing, a user can only see the most recent contribution to a story, and 
  can only read the entire story after contributing to it.
  We will be using components like Flask to create a server and sqlite to store data.
  If done correctly, an user should be able to navigate through quality contents
  seamlessly and can edit/push new contents.

How to Clone/Install:
  * Pull our GitHub, the codes are all there and public
  * Download Flask and Sqlite using pip install
  * To run do python3 `__init__.py`
