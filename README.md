Description:
  A wiki web that could be edited by anyone who is signed in! To do this, we will
be using components like Flask to create a server and sqlite to store data.
If done correctly, an user should be able to navigate through quality contents
seamlessly and can edit/push new contents.

How to Clone/Install:
  * Pull our GitHub, the codes are all there and public
  * Download Flask and Sqlite using pip install
  * To run do python3 __init__.py
